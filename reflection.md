# What is a web server?
A web server is a software and hardware combination that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to user requests made over the World Wide Web. It delivers content, such as web pages, using the internet, to the user's device.

# How do users access resources from a web server?
Users access resources from a web server by entering a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in a web browser or through an application that makes HTTP requests. The server then responds with the requested resources, such as HTML pages, images, or files.

# What are GET and POST?
GET and POST are two of the most common HTTP methods used in web applications and APIs.
GET is used to request data from a specified resource. GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, and they remain in the browser history. They should not be used for sensitive data.
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST requests do not remain in the browser history, cannot be bookmarked, and have no restrictions on data length.
This setup allows you to handle both displaying and submitting content with GET and POST methods, aligning with web standards for user interaction and data handling.
